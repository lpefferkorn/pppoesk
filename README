What is it ? 

PPPoE session killer

pppoesk is a small C program which goal is to terminate a bogus PPPoE session in an automatic way.
PPPoE 

PPPoE is a protocol which establish a link between the ISP's access concentrator and your network device. It encapsulate successively PPP and IP protocols.

A PPPoE session is established this way :rfc2516

    * your network device send a PADI packet (PPPoE Active Discovery Initiation)
    * answer from one or several access concentrator with a PADO packet (PPPoE Active Discovery Offer)
    * selection of the concentrator with a PADR packet (PPPoE Active Discovery Request)
    * acknowledgement by the choosen concentrator with a PADS packet(PPPoE Active Discovery Session-confirmation) then a session's specific ID is created. 

Now the connection is established and is uniquely identified by the 3 following parameters :

    * MAC address of the access concentrator
    * MAC addressof your network device
    * session ID 

Terminate the session is possible at PPP layer or at PPPoE layer with a PADT packet, which must be send to the access concentrator.
Bogus session (or ghost session) 

The PPPoE session can be abruptly aborded (poor phone line quality,...), without the access concentrator being informated because no PADT packet was sent.

Thus, from the access concentrator's side, the session is still valid and you must wait a certain amount of time for the concentrator to reset the bogus session, thereby a new PPPoE session can be established.

Packets's story

    * client : sending PADI packet
    * access concentrator(s) : answer with a PADO packet
    * client : a access concentrator is choosen help to a PADR packet
    * access concentrator : hum, a session is already established, I can't open more than 1 session
    * client : ... 

This amount of time is maybe ISP specific, and is, where I live (France) at most 24h

With my ISP I have to wait one or two hours.
How pppoesk works 

A PPPoE PADT (Terminate) packet is forged with session's parameters :

    * MAC address client side
    * MAC address ISP side
    * session ID 

then send the packet to close the session on the ISP's concentrator access

It's also possible to use the pppoe command with -p -e parameters like described in the manual page :

-k     Causes  pppoe to terminate an existing session by sending a PADT
       frame, and then exit.  You must use the -e option in conjunction
       with  this  option  to specify the session to kill.  This may be
       useful for killing sessions when a buggy peer does  not  realize
       the session has ended

But you need to get MAC adresses and session ID (help to logs or tcpdump) then use them adequately with pppoe command :

pppoesk does this in an automatic way :

    * sniff traffic on ethernet interface connected to the DSL modem
    * search for MAC addresses and session ID
    * forge PPPoE PADT packet
    * send the packet 

Results 

PPPoE session is closed in seconds on the access concentrator side, and it's possible to re-establish a new one immediately.
Notes 

Of course it's possible to achieve same result with a shell script, but it's a bit less easy

I firstly wrote this program to enhance my knowledge in C and to learn libnet and libpcap libraries.
